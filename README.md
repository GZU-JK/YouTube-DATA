As the investment properties and financial properties of cryptocurrencies are accepted or recognized by major listed companies and even sovereign countries, they are increasingly sought after by ordinary investors around the world. The frantic influx of a large number of investors into the cryptocurrency market has also led to more and more market analysis and predictions for retail investors and new investors, as well as popular science teaching videos on YouTube. However, their sentiment towards cryptocurrency is not. It must be "right". To ascertain the attitude of video producers in YouTube videos towards the market, this article uses sentiment analysis to analyze the videos and compare the similarity with the Bitcoin fluctuation data before and after the video upload. We found that in most cases, video producers have a high degree of similarity with the ups and downs of the period before the release of the video, but the low similarity to the trend for some time in the future. This shows that the cryptocurrency-related videos on YouTube merely reflect past ups and downs and cannot be used as investment advice, even if the video uploaders are doing so.
